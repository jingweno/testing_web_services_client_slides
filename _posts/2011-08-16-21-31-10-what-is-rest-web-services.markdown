### What is REST web service?

#### REST == Representational State Transfer

1. HTTP: CRUD - POST, GET, PUT, DELETE
2. resources: anything we expose to the web, e.g., a tweet
3. identifiers: a URI uniquely identifies a web resource, e.g., http://api.twitter.com/tweets
4. representations: a transformation or a view of a resourceâ€™s state at an instant time, e.g., JSON
